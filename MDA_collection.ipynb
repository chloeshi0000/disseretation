The Company\\u2019s products and services include iPhone \\u00ae , iPad \\u00ae ,\\nMac \\u00ae , Apple Watch \\u00ae , Apple TV \\u00ae , a portfolio of consumer and professional software applications, iOS, macOS \\u00ae , watchOS \\u00ae and tvOS\\u2122 operating\\nsystems, iCloud \\u00ae , Apple Pay \\u00ae and a variety of accessory, service and support offerings. The Company sells and delivers digital content and applications\\nthrough the iTunes Store \\u00ae , App Store \\u00ae , Mac App Store, TV App Store, iBooks Store\\u2122 and Apple Music \\u00ae (collectively \\u201cDigital Content and Services\\u201d). The\\nCompany sells its products worldwide through its retail stores, online stores and direct sales force, as well as through third-party cellular network carriers,\\nwholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers. In addition, the Company sells a variety of third-party Apple-compatible products, including application software\\nand various accessories through its retail and online stores. The Company sells to consumers, small and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and\\ngovernment customers.\\nBusiness Strategy\\nThe Company is committed to bringing the best user experience to its customers through its innovative hardware, software and services. The Company\\u2019s\\nbusiness strategy leverages its unique ability to design and develop its own operating systems, hardware, application software and services to provide its\\ncustomers products and solutions with innovative design, superior ease-of-use and seamless integration. As part of its strategy, the Company continues to\\nexpand its platform for the discovery and delivery of digital content and applications through its Digital Content and Services, which allows customers to discover\\nand download digital content, iOS, Mac, Apple Watch and Apple TV applications, and books through either a Mac or Windows personal computer or through\\niPhone, iPad and iPod touch \\u00ae devices (\\u201ciOS devices\\u201d), Apple TV and Apple Watch.

Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact\\nthe Company\\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often,\\nchannel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and\\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered\\nreliable indicators of the Company\\u2019s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.\\nFiscal Period\\nThe Company\\u2019s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company\\u2019s fiscal year 2017 will include 53 weeks and\\nwill end on September 30, 2017 . A 14th week was included in the first quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign the Company\\u2019s fiscal\\nquarters with calendar quarters.\\nSecond Quarter Fiscal 2017 Highlights\\nNet sales increased 5% or $2.3 billion during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016, primarily driven by strong growth in Services,\\nMac and Other Products, partially offset by the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Net sales reflected year-over-year growth in\\neach of the geographic operating segments, with the exception of Greater China. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company introduced a new 9.7-inch\\niPad, which became available at the end of the quarter.\\nThe Company utilized $7.0 billion to repurchase shares of its common stock and paid dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.0 billion during the second\\nquarter of 2017. Additionally, the Company issued $11.0 billion of U.S. dollar-denominated long-term debt.\\nSales Data\\nThe following table shows net sales by operating segment and net sales and unit sales by product for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2017 and\\nMarch 26, 2016 (dollars in millions and units in thousands):\\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\\nApril 1, March 26, April 1, March 26,\\n2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change\\nNet Sales by Operating Segment:\\nAmericas $ 21,157 $ 19,096 11 % $ 53,125 $ 48,421 10 %\\nEurope 12,733 11,535 10 % 31,254 29,467 6 %\\nGreater China 10,726 12,486 (14)% 26,959 30,859 (13)%\\nJapan 4,485 4,281 5 % 10,251 9,075 13 %\\nRest of Asia Pacific 3,795 3,159 20 % 9,658 8,607 12 %\\nTotal net sales $ 52,896 $ 50,557 5 % $ 131,247 $ 126,429 4 %\\nNet Sales by Product:\\niPhone (1) $ 33,249 $ 32,857 1 % $ 87,627 $ 84,492 4 %\\niPad (1) 3,889 4,413 (12)% 9,422 11,497 (18)%\\nMac (1) 5,844 5,107 14 % 13,088 11,853 10 %\\nServices (2) 7,041 5,991 18 % 14,213 12,047 18 %\\nOther Products (1)(3) 2,873 2,189 31 % 6,897 6,540 5 %\\nTotal net sales $ 52,896 $ 50,557 5 % $ 131,247 $ 126,429 4 %\\nUnit Sales by Product:\\niPhone 50,763 51,193 (1)% 129,053 125,972 2 %\\niPad 8,922 10,251 (13)% 22,003 26,373 (17)%\\nMac 4,199 4,034 4 % 9,573 9,346 2 %\\n(1) Includes deferrals and amortization of related software upgrade rights and non-software services.\\n(2) Includes revenue from Digital Content and Services, AppleCare \\u00ae , Apple Pay, licensing and other services.\\n(3) Includes sales of Apple TV, Apple Watch, Beats \\u00ae products, iPod and Apple-branded and third-party accessories.\\n24\\nPage 25\\nProduct Performance\\niPhone\\nThe following table presents iPhone net sales and unit sales information for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2017 and March 26, 2016 (dollars in\\nmillions and units in thousands):\\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\\nApril 1, March 26, April 1, March 26,\\n2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change\\nNet sales $ 33,249 $ 32,857 1 % $ 87,627 $ 84,492 4%\\nPercentage of total net sales 63% 65% 67% 67%\\nUnit sales 50,763 51,193 (1)% 129,053 125,972 2%\\niPhone net sales increased during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 due to higher iPhone average selling prices (\\u201cASPs\\u201d),\\nlargely offset by the effect of weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar.

The foregoing statement regarding the Company\\u2019s\\nexpected gross margin percentage in the third quarter of 2017 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company\\u2019s future gross margins can\\nbe impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading \\u201cRisk Factors\\u201d and those\\ndescribed in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including\\ncontinued industry-wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the\\ncost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential\\nshift in the Company\\u2019s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take\\nproduct pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\\u2019s ability to manage product quality\\nand warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company\\u2019s significant international operations, its financial\\ncondition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.\\nOperating Expenses\\nOperating expenses for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2017 and March 26, 2016 were as follows (dollars in millions):\\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\\nApril 1, March 26, April 1, March 26,\\n2017 2016 2017 2016\\nResearch and development $ 2,776 $ 2,511 $ 5,647 $ 4,915\\nPercentage of total net sales 5% 5% 4% 4%\\nSelling, general and administrative $ 3,718 $ 3,423 $ 7,664 $ 7,271\\nPercentage of total net sales 7% 7% 6% 6%\\nTotal operating expenses $ 6,494 $ 5,934 $ 13,311 $ 12,186\\nPercentage of total net sales 12% 12% 10% 10%\\nResearch and Development\\nThe growth in R&D expense during the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in\\nheadcount and related expenses to support expanded R&D activities. The Company continues to believe that focused investments in R&D are critical to its\\nfuture growth and competitive position in the marketplace, and to the development of new and updated products that are central to the Company\\u2019s core business\\nstrategy.\\nSelling, General and Administrative\\nThe growth in selling, general and administrative expense during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same quarter in 2016 was driven primarily by an\\nincrease in headcount and related expenses and higher spending on marketing and advertising. The year-over-year growth in selling, general and administrative\\nexpense during the first six months of 2017 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses and higher variable selling costs.\\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\\nOther income/(expense), net for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2017 and March 26, 2016 was as follows (dollars in millions):\\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\\nApril 1, March 26, April 1, March 26,\\n2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Change\\nInterest and dividend income $ 1,282 $ 986 $ 2,506 $ 1,927\\nInterest expense (530) (321) (1,055) (597)\\nOther expense, net (165) (510) (43) (773)\\nTotal other income/(expense), net $ 587 $ 155 279% $ 1,408 $ 557 153%\\nThe increase in other income/(expense), net during the second quarter and first six months of 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 was due primarily to\\nhigher interest income and the favorable impact of foreign exchange-related items, partially offset by higher interest expense on debt. The weighted-average\\ninterest rate earned by the Company on its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was 1.99% and 1.74% in the second quarter of 2017 and 2016,\\nrespectively, and 1.93% and 1.70% in the first six months of 2017 and 2016, respectively.\\nProvision for Income Taxes\\nProvision for income taxes and effective tax rates for the three- and six-month periods ended April 1, 2017 and March 26, 2016 were as follows (dollars in\\nmillions):\\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended\\nApril 1, March 26, April 1, March 26,\\n2017 2016 2017 2016\\nProvision for income taxes $ 3,655 $ 3,626 $ 9,944 $ 9,838\\nEffective tax rate 24.9% 25.6% 25.6% 25.4%\\nThe Company\\u2019s effective tax rates during the second quarter of 2017 and 2016 differ from the statutory federal income tax rate of 35% due primarily to certain\\nundistributed foreign earnings, a substantial portion of which was generated by subsidiaries organized in Ireland, for which no U.S. taxes are provided when\\nsuch earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. The lower effective tax rate during the second quarter of 2017 compared to the same\\nPage 29\\nquarter in 2016 was due primarily to a different geographic mix of earnings. The slightly higher effective tax rate in the first six months of 2017 compared to the\\nsame period in 2016 was due primarily to the retroactive reinstatement of the U.S. federal R&D tax credit during the first quarter of 2016.\\nThe Company is subject to audits by federal, state, local and foreign tax authorities. Management believes that adequate provisions have been made for any\\nadjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any issues addressed in the\\nCompany\\u2019s tax audits are resolved in a manner not consistent with management\\u2019s expectations, the Company could be required to adjust its provision for\\nincome taxes in the period such resolution occurs.\\nOn August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and\\n2007 concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the Company (the \\u201cState Aid Decision\\u201d). The State Aid Decision orders\\nIreland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of\\nJanuary 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be without merit and\\nappealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. While the European\\nCommission announced a recovery amount of up to \\u20ac13 billion , plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by\\nIreland in accordance with the European Commission's guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Ireland, the Company anticipates funding it,\\nincluding interest, out of foreign cash into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all appeals. The Company believes that any incremental Irish\\ncorporate income taxes potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.S. taxes.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nRestricted Cash\\nIn November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\\u201cASU\\u201d) No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows\\n(Topic 230): Restricted Cash (\\u201cASU 2016-18\\u201d), which enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of restricted cash in the\\nstatement of cash flows. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-18 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the retrospective adoption method. Currently, the Company's\\nrestricted cash balance is not significant.\\nIncome Taxes\\nIn October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory (\\u201cASU 2016-16\\u201d), which\\nrequires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company will\\nadopt ASU 2016-16 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective adoption method. Currently, the Company anticipates recording up to $9 billion\\nof net deferred tax assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-16 will depend on the balance of intellectual\\nproperty transferred between its subsidiaries as of the adoption date. The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense thereafter as these\\ndeferred tax assets are utilized.\\nStock Compensation\\nIn March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation \\u2013 Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment\\nAccounting (\\u201cASU 2016-09\\u201d), which modifies certain aspects of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, classification of\\nawards, and classification in the statement of cash flows. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-09 in its first quarter of 2018. Currently, excess tax benefits or\\ndeficiencies from the Company's equity awards are recorded as additional paid-in capital in its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Upon adoption, the Company will\\nrecord any excess tax benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards in its Consolidated Statements of Operations in the reporting periods in which vesting\\noccurs. As a result, subsequent to adoption the Company's income tax expense and associated effective tax rate will be impacted by fluctuations in stock price\\nbetween the grant dates and vesting dates of equity awards.\\n28\\nPage 30\\nLeases\\nIn February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) (\\u201cASU 2016-02\\u201d), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase\\ntransparency and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. ASU\\n2016-02 will be effective for the Company beginning in its first quarter of 2020, and early adoption is permitted. The Company will use a modified retrospective\\nadoption approach. While the Company is currently evaluating the timing and impact of adopting ASU 2016-02, currently the Company anticipates recording\\nlease assets and liabilities in excess of $8.2 billion on its Consolidated Balance Sheets, with no material impact to its Consolidated Statements of Operations.\\nHowever, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2016-02 will depend on the Company's lease portfolio as of the adoption date.\\nFinancial Instruments\\nIn January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments \\u2013 Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and\\nFinancial Liabilities (\\u201cASU 2016-01\\u201d), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments. The\\nCompany will adopt ASU 2016-01 in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective adoption method. Based on the composition of the Company's\\ninvestment portfolio, the adoption of ASU 2016-01 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments \\u2013 Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\\n(\\u201cASU 2016-13\\u201d), which modifies the measurement of expected credit losses of certain financial instruments. The Company will adopt ASU 2016-13 in its first\\nquarter of 2021 utilizing the modified retrospective adoption method. Based on the composition of the Company's investment portfolio, current market conditions,\\nand historical credit loss activity, the adoption of ASU 2016-13 is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\\nRevenue Recognition\\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\\u201cASU 2014-09\\u201d), which amends the existing accounting\\nstandards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled\\nwhen products are transferred to customers.\\nSubsequently, the FASB has issued the following standards related to ASU 2014-09: ASU No. 2016-08, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606):\\nPrincipal versus Agent Considerations (\\u201cASU 2016-08\\u201d); ASU No. 2016-10, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Identifying Performance\\nObligations and Licensing (\\u201cASU 2016-10\\u201d); ASU No. 2016-12, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical\\nExpedients (\\u201cASU 2016-12\\u201d); and ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\\u201cASU\\n2016-20\\u201d). The Company must adopt ASU 2016-08, ASU 2016-10, ASU 2016-12 and ASU 2016-20 with ASU 2014-09 (collectively, the \\u201cnew revenue\\nstandards\\u201d).\\nThe new revenue standards may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect recognized as of the date\\nof adoption. The Company plans to adopt the new revenue standards in its first quarter of 2019 utilizing the full retrospective adoption method. The new revenue\\nstandards are not expected to have a material impact on the amount and timing of revenue recognized in the Company's consolidated financial statements.\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nThe following tables present selected financial information and statistics as of April 1, 2017 and September 24, 2016 and for the first six months of 2017 and\\n2016 (in millions):\\nApril 1, September 24,\\n2017 2016\\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 256,841 $ 237,585\\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 27,163 $ 27,010\\nCommercial paper $ 9,992 $ 8,105\\nTotal term debt $ 88,530 $ 78,927\\nWorking capital $ 28,648 $ 27,863\\nSix Months Ended\\nApril 1, March 26,\\n2017 2016\\nCash generated by operating activities $ 39,579 $ 39,064\\nCash used in investing activities $ (33,324) $ (34,110)\\nCash used in financing activities $ (11,582) $ (4,560)\\n29\\nPage 31\\nThe Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital\\nasset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.

Our traffic acquisition costs as a percentage of advertising revenues was 23%.\\n\\u2022 Operating expenses (excluding cost of revenues) were $8.8 billion.\\n\\u2022 Income from operations was $7.8 billion.\\n\\u2022 Effective tax rate was 16%.\\n\\u2022 Net income was $6.7 billion with diluted net income per share of $9.57.\\n\\u2022 Operating cash flow was $9.9 billion.\\n\\u2022 Capital expenditures were $3.5 billion.\\n\\u2022 Headcount increased to 78,101 as of September 30, 2017.\\nInformation about Segments\\nWe operate our business in multiple operating segments. Google is our only reportable segment. None of our\\nother segments meet the quantitative thresholds to qualify as reportable segments; therefore, the other operating\\nsegments are combined and disclosed below as Other Bets.\\nOur reported segments are described below:\\n\\u2022 Google \\u2013 Google includes our main internet products such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube,\\nGoogle Cloud, Android, Chrome, and Google Play as well as our hardware initiatives. Our technical\\ninfrastructure and some newer efforts like virtual reality are also included in Google. Google generates\\nrevenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps, in-app purchases, and digital content; services fees for\\ncloud offerings; and sales of hardware products.\\n\\u2022 Other Bets \\u2013 Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material.\\nOther Bets includes businesses such as Access, Calico, CapitalG, GV, Nest, Verily, Waymo, and X. Revenues\\nfrom the Other Bets are derived primarily through the sales of internet and TV services through Google Fiber,\\nsales of Nest products and services, and licensing and R&D services through Verily.\\nSee Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report\\non Form 10-Q for further information.

Paid clicks for our Google Network Members' properties\\ninclude clicks by end-users related to advertisements served on Google Network Members' properties participating in\\nAdSense for Search, AdSense for Content, and AdMob. In some cases, such as programmatic and reservation based\\nadvertising buying, we primarily charge advertisers by impression; while growing, this represents a small part of our\\nrevenue base.\\nCost-per-click is defined as click-driven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the\\naverage amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\\nWe periodically review, refine and update our methodologies for monitoring, gathering, and counting the number\\nof paid clicks and for identifying the revenues generated by click activity.\\n32\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204417000042/goog10-qq32017.htm 40/62\\nPage 41\\n6/1/24, 9:51 PM Document\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\nIn the first quarter of 2017, we refined our methodology for paid clicks and cost-per-click to include additional\\ncategories of TrueView engagement ads and exclude non-engagement based trial ad formats. This change resulted in\\na modest increase in paid clicks and a modest decrease in cost-per-click. For comparison purposes, we have included\\nupdated data for historical periods in the table below:\\nThree Months Ended\\nMar 31, 2016 Jun 30, 2016 Sep 30, 2016 Dec 31, 2016\\nYear-over-year change\\nAggregate paid clicks 29 % 28 % 32 % 39 %\\nPaid clicks on Google properties 38 % 36 % 41 % 47 %\\nPaid clicks on Google Network Members' properties 2 % 0 % 1 % 7 %\\nAggregate cost-per-click (8)% (6)% (10)% (17)%\\nCost-per-click on Google properties (11)% (8)% (12)% (18)%\\nCost-per-click on Google Network Members'\\nproperties (8)% (8)% (14)% (19)%\\nQuarter-over-quarter change\\nAggregate paid clicks (2)% 7 % 9 % 22 %\\nPaid clicks on Google properties (3)% 9 % 11 % 25 %\\nPaid clicks on Google Network Members' properties 4 % (3)% 1 % 6 %\\nAggregate cost-per-click (1)% (1)% (5)% (10)%\\nCost-per-click on Google properties 1 % (2)% (6)% (12)%\\nCost-per-click on Google Network Members'\\nproperties (12)% (2)% (6)% 0 %\\nOur advertising revenue growth and the change in advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid\\nclicks and cost-per-click on Google properties and Google Network Members' properties and the correlation between\\nthese items, have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate because of various factors, including:\\n\\u2022 growth rates of revenues from Google properties, including YouTube, compared to growth rates of revenues\\nfrom Google Network Members' properties;\\n\\u2022 advertiser competition for keywords;\\n\\u2022 changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\\n\\u2022 seasonality;\\n\\u2022 the fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;\\n\\u2022 changes in advertising quality or formats;\\n\\u2022 changes in device mix;\\n\\u2022 traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising verticals\\nand channels;\\n\\u2022 a shift in the proportion of non-click based revenues generated on Google properties and Google Network\\nMembers' properties, including an increase in programmatic and reservation based advertising buying; and\\n\\u2022 general economic conditions.\\nOur advertising revenue growth rate has fluctuated over time as a result of a number of factors, including\\nincreasing competition, query growth rates, challenges in maintaining our growth rate as our revenues increase to\\nhigher levels, the evolution of the online advertising market, our investments in new business strategies, changes in\\nour product mix, and shifts in the geographic mix of our revenues. We also expect that our revenue growth rate will\\ncontinue to be affected by evolving user preferences, the acceptance by users of our products and services as they are\\ndelivered on diverse devices, our ability to create a seamless experience for both users and advertisers, and\\nmovements in foreign currency exchange rates.\\n33\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204417000042/goog10-qq32017.htm 41/62\\nPage 42\\n6/1/24, 9:51 PM Document\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\nGoogle properties\\nThe following table presents our Google properties revenues (in millions, unaudited), and changes in our paid\\nclicks and cost-per-click (expressed as a percentage):\\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\\nSeptember 30, September 30,\\n2016 2017 2016 2017\\nGoogle properties revenues $ 16,089 $ 19,723 $ 45,817 $ 55,551\\nGoogle properties revenues as a percentage of\\nGoogle segment revenues 72.3% 71.8 % 72.0% 71.5 %\\nPaid clicks change 55 % 57 %\\nCost-per-click change (21)% (22)%\\nGoogle properties revenues consist primarily of advertising revenues that are generated on:\\n\\u2022 Google search properties which includes revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who\\nuse Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.;\\n\\u2022 Other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play; and\\n\\u2022 YouTube, including but not limited to, YouTube TrueView and Google Preferred.\\nOur Google properties revenues increased $3,634 million from the three months ended September 30, 2016 to\\nthe three months ended September 30, 2017. The growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search resulting\\nfrom ongoing growth in user adoption and usage, as well as continued growth in advertiser activity. We also\\nexperienced growth in desktop search due to improvements in ad formats and delivery, as well as growth in YouTube\\ndriven primarily by video advertising.\\nOur Google properties revenues increased $9,734 million from the nine months ended September 30, 2016 to the\\nnine months ended September 30, 2017. The growth was primarily driven by increases in mobile search resulting from\\nongoing growth in user adoption and usage, as well as continued growth in advertiser activity. We also experienced\\ngrowth in YouTube driven primarily by video advertising.

Our international revenues are favorably impacted as the U.S. dollar weakens relative to other foreign\\ncurrencies, and unfavorably impacted as the U.S dollar strengthens relative to other foreign currencies. We use non-\\nGAAP constant currency revenues and constant currency revenue growth for financial and operational decision-making\\nand as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant\\ncurrency basis in addition to GAAP results helps improve the ability to understand our performance because they\\nexclude the effects of foreign currency volatility that are not indicative of our core operating results.\\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the impact of foreign exchange\\nrate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue growth on a year-on-\\nyear basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current period revenues using prior period\\nexchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging impacts realized in the current period.\\nConstant currency revenue growth (expressed as a percentage) is calculated by determining the increase in\\ncurrent period revenues over prior period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are translated\\nusing prior period exchange rates and hedging benefits are excluded from revenues of both periods.\\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures\\nused by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\\n36\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204417000042/goog10-qq32017.htm 45/62\\nPage 46\\n6/1/24, 9:51 PM Document\\nTable of Contents Alphabet Inc.\\nThe following table presents the foreign exchange impact on our international revenues and total revenues (in\\nmillions, unaudited):\\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended\\nSeptember 30, September 30,\\n2016 2017 2016 2017\\nEMEA revenues $ 7,392 $ 9,097 $ 22,007 $ 25,733\\nExclude foreign exchange impact on current\\nperiod revenues using prior year rates 361 (283) 867 557\\nExclude hedging impact recognized in current\\nperiod (104) 161 (293) 15\\nEMEA constant currency revenues $ 7,649 $ 8,975 $ 22,581 $ 26,305\\nPrior period EMEA revenues, excluding hedging\\nimpact $ 6,286 $ 7,288 $ 18,405 $ 21,714\\nEMEA revenue growth 14% 23% 15% 17%\\nEMEA constant currency revenue growth 22% 23% 23% 21%\\nAPAC revenues $ 3,248 $ 4,199 $ 8,951 $ 11,548\\nExclude foreign exchange impact on current\\nperiod revenues using prior year rates (210) 54 (142) (33)\\nExclude hedging impact recognized in current\\nperiod 0 18 (31) (52)\\nAPAC constant currency revenues $ 3,038 $ 4,271 $ 8,778 $ 11,463\\nPrior period APAC revenues, excluding hedging\\nimpact $ 2,406 $ 3,248 $ 6,893 $ 8,920\\nAPAC revenue growth 30% 29% 25% 29%\\nAPAC constant currency revenue growth 26% 31% 27% 29%\\nOther Americas revenues $ 1,162 $ 1,546 $ 3,185 $ 4,230\\nExclude foreign exchange impact on current\\nperiod revenues using prior year rates 45 (26) 346 (111)\\nExclude hedging impact recognized in current\\nperiod (1) 12 (28) 8\\nOther Americas constant currency revenues $ 1,206 $ 1,532 $ 3,503 $ 4,127\\nPrior period Other Americas revenues, excluding\\nhedging impact $ 949 $ 1,161 $ 2,777 $ 3,157\\nOther Americas revenue growth 20% 33% 12% 33%\\nOther Americas constant currency revenue growth 27% 32% 26% 31%\\nUnited States revenues $ 10,649 $ 12,930 $ 30,065 $ 37,021\\nUnited States revenue growth 22% 21% 23% 23%\\nTotal revenues $ 22,451 $ 27,772 $ 64,208 $ 78,532\\nTotal constant currency revenues $ 22,542 $ 27,708 $ 64,927 $ 78,916\\nTotal revenue growth 20% 24% 20% 22%\\nTotal constant currency revenue growth 23% 24% 23% 24%\\nFor the three months ended September 30, 2017, our revenues from EMEA were favorably impacted by changes\\nin foreign currency exchange rates, primarily because the U.S. dollar weakened relative to the Euro.

Cash\\nequivalents and marketable securities are comprised of time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid\\ndebt instruments of the U.S. government and its agencies, debt instruments issued by foreign governments, debt\\ninstruments issued by municipalities in the U.S., corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and\\nasset-backed securities. From time to time, we may hold marketable equity securities obtained through acquisitions or\\nstrategic investments in private companies that subsequently go public.\\nAs of September 30, 2017, $60.5 billion of the $100.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\\nwere held by our foreign subsidiaries. If these funds were needed for our operations in the U.S., we would be required\\nto accrue and pay U.S. taxes to repatriate these funds. However, our intent is to permanently reinvest these funds\\noutside of the U.S. and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate them to fund our U.S. operations.\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash\\nflow that we generate from our operations. We have a short-term debt financing program of up to $5.0 billion through\\nthe issuance of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had\\nno commercial paper outstanding as of September 30, 2017. We have a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility expiring in\\nFebruary 2021. The interest rate for the credit facility is determined based on a formula using certain market rates. As\\nof September 30, 2017, no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility. We believe that our sources of funding\\nwill be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated cash requirements including capital expenditures, working capital\\nrequirements, potential acquisitions, and other liquidity requirements through at least the next 12 months.\\nAs of September 30, 2017, we have senior unsecured notes outstanding due in 2021, 2024, and 2026 with a total\\ncarrying value of $3.9 billion and a total estimated fair value of $4.0 billion.\\nIn October 2016, the board of directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to\\n$7,019,340,976.83 of its Class C capital stock.

These items were offset by decreases in\\nproceeds received from the issuance of debt and increases in net payments related to stock-based award activities.\\nContractual Obligations\\nWe had long-term taxes payable of $4.4 billion as of September 30, 2017 primarily related to uncertain tax\\npositions. At this time, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual\\nyears beyond 12 months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting\\nPrinciples (GAAP). In doing so, we have to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported amounts of\\nassets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses, as well as related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. In some\\ncases, we could reasonably have used different accounting policies and estimates. In some cases, changes in the\\naccounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual results could differ\\nmaterially from our estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual\\nresults, our financial condition or results of operations will be affected. We base our estimates on past experience and\\nother assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, and we evaluate these estimates on an\\nongoing basis. We refer to accounting estimates of this type as critical accounting policies and estimates, which we\\ndiscuss further below. We have reviewed our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our\\nboard of directors.\\nRevenues\\nFor the sale of third-party goods and services, we evaluate whether we are the principal, and report revenues on a\\ngross basis, or an agent, and report revenues on a net basis. In this assessment, we consider if we obtain control of\\nthe specified goods or services before they are transferred to the customer, as well as other indicators such as the\\nparty primarily responsible for fulfillment, inventory risk, and discretion in establishing price.\\nSee Note 1 of Part I, Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the summary of significant accounting\\npolicies.

Management\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nForward-Looking Statements\\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All\\nstatements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial\\nposition, made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar\\nexpressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management\\u2019s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual\\nresults could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and\\ncustomer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business\\nopportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with\\nservices, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and\\nexpansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality,\\nthe degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment\\nthroughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks\\nand uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management\\u2019s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part II,\\n\\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d\\nFor additional information, see Item 7 of Part II, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \\u2014 Overview\\u201d of\\nour 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCritical Accounting Judgments\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The\\nSEC has defined a company\\u2019s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company\\u2019s financial condition and results of\\noperations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are\\ninherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key\\naccounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information,\\nsee Item 8 of Part II, \\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \\u2014 Note 1 \\u2014 Description of Business and Accounting Policies,\\u201d of our 2015 Annual Report\\non Form 10-K and Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial Statements \\u2014 Note 1 \\u2014 Accounting Policies,\\u201d of this Form 10-Q. Although we believe that our estimates,\\nassumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under\\ndifferent assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\\nInventories\\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost or\\nmarket value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales\\nto individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future\\ndisposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a\\nmeasure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of June 30, 2016 , we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of\\napproximately $110 million .\\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If\\nwe reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\\nGoodwill\\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be\\nrecoverable. The measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment test is April 1. In testing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative\\nassessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment\\nindicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment\\ntest by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative\\nfactors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired,\\n17\\nPage 18\\nTable of Contents\\na second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We\\nestimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and\\noperating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of\\ndiscounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could\\nsignificantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.\\nWe completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1, 2016, and determined that goodwill was not\\nimpaired. During the quarter, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill\\nimpairment test. For the periods presented, no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10%\\ndecrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of April 1, 2016, would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill.\\nFinancial and credit market volatility directly impacts the fair value measurement through our weighted-average cost of capital that we use to determine a\\ndiscount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to\\ndetermine whether credit or stock price changes are short-term in nature or a longer-term trend. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting\\nmethodology used to evaluate goodwill for impairment. Changes in our estimated future cash flows and asset fair values may cause us to realize material\\nimpairment charges in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, a prolonged 20% decrease from our June 30, 2016 closing stock price would not be an indicator of\\npossible impairment.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest.\\nThe fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and the fair value of stock\\noptions is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the\\nextent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are\\nrevised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee level, economic conditions, time remaining to vest, and historical\\nforfeiture experience. We update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate\\nstock-based compensation. Changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future.\\nAs a measure of sensitivity, a 1% change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately $60 million impact on our Q2 2016 operating income.\\nOur estimated forfeiture rate as of June 30, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 , was 28% .\\nWe utilize the accelerated method, rather than the straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. For example, over 50% of the compensation\\ncost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the compensation expense adjustment\\nis much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in\\nvarious jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and\\nestimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax\\ndetermination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates\\nand higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize the related tax\\nbenefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions (including\\nintegrations) and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws,\\nregulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. The\\nU.S., the European Union and its member states, and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard.\\nExcept as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously\\ntaxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S.\\noperations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected.\\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us.\\n18\\nPage 19\\nTable of Contents\\nDevelopments in an audit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our\\noperating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, the IRS is\\nseeking to increase our U.S. taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006, and we are\\ncurrently contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions, if this litigation is adversely determined\\nor if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax\\nliabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in\\nLuxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If this matter is adversely\\nresolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and we may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior periods and our taxes in the\\nfuture could increase. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any related litigation could be\\nmaterially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial Statements \\u2014 Note 1 \\u2014 Accounting Policies \\u2014 Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\\u201d\\n19\\nPage 20\\nTable of Contents\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended Six Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\\nJune 30, June 30, June 30,\\n2016 2015 2016 2015 2016 2015\\nCash provided by (used in):\\nOperating activities $ 3,465 $ 1,997 $ 1,305 $ 498 $ 12,726 $ 8,980\\nInvesting activities (2,439) (1,376) (3,132) (3,223) (6,360) (6,634)\\nFinancing activities (1,039) (691) (1,828) (1,344) (4,247) 3,453\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair\\nvalue, were $16.5 billion and $19.8 billion as of June 30, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 . Amounts held in foreign currencies were $5.9 billion and $7.3 billion as\\nof June 30, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 , and were primarily Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds.\\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $3.5 billion and $2.0 billion for Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 , and $1.3 billion and $498 million for the six\\nmonths ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 . Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content\\ncreator customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee\\ncompensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal-use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related\\ntransaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally\\ncorresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in\\noperating cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2016 , compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in net\\nincome, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation, offset by changes in working capital. Working capital at\\nany specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and\\npayments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and\\nwebsite development costs, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of\\nmarketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(2.4) billion and $(1.4) billion for Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 , and $(3.1) billion and $(3.2)\\nbillion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 , with the variability caused primarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment,\\npurchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities, and changes in cash paid for acquisitions. Cash capital expenditures were $1.7 billion and $1.2 billion\\nduring Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 , and $2.9 billion and $2.1 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 . This primarily reflects additional investments in\\nsupport of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS) and additional capacity to support\\nour fulfillment operations. Capital expenditures included $118 million and $150 million for internal-use software and website development during Q2 2016 and Q2\\n2015 , and $229 million and $279 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 . Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and\\nwebsite development costs does not affect cash flows. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $14\\nmillion and $8 million during Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 , and $30 million and $374 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 .\\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1.0) billion and $(691) million for Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 , and $(1.8) billion and $(1.3) billion for the\\nsix months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 . Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and\\nfinance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other. Principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-\\nterm debt and other were $1.2 billion and $830 million in Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 , and $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and\\n2015 . Property and equipment acquired under capital leases was $1.4 billion during Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 , and $2.3 billion for the six months ended June 30,\\n2016 and 2015 , reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which\\ninvestments we expect to continue over time. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and other and tax benefits\\nrelating to excess stock-based compensation deductions. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $66 million and $44 million in Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 , and\\n$75 million and $226 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 . Tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions are presented\\nas financing cash flows. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were $113 million and $95 million in Q2 2016 and Q2\\n2015 , and $320 million and $117 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 .\\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under our $3.0 billion Credit Agreement as of June 30, 2016 . See Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial Statements \\u2014 Note 4 \\u2014\\nLong-Term Debt\\u201d for additional information.\\n20\\nPage 21\\nTable of Contents\\nWe recorded net tax provisions of $307 million and $266 million in Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 , and $782 million and $337 million for the six months ended June\\n30, 2016 and 2015 . Except as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not\\nbeen previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our\\nU.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings, and our effective tax rate would be adversely\\naffected. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our\\nU.S. taxable income. In December 2015, U.S. legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019. Cash\\ntaxes paid (net of refunds) were $88 million and $65 million for Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 , and $226 million and $119 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016\\nand 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $1.1 billion and we had approximately $622 million of\\nfederal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development\\ncredit, which was made permanent in 2015. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits, we expect cash paid for taxes to significantly increase.\\nWe endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis.\\nOur liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for standby and trade letters of credit, guarantees, debt, and real estate\\nleases. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of\\nthose funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from \\u201cCash and cash equivalents\\u201d to restricted cash,\\nwhich is classified within \\u201cAccounts receivable, net and other\\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. As of June 30, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 , restricted cash,\\ncash equivalents, and marketable securities were $456 million and $285 million . See Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial Statements \\u2014 Note 3 \\u2014 Commitments and\\nContingencies\\u201d for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders,\\nconsisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $8.7 billion as of June 30, 2016 . Purchase obligations and open purchase orders are\\ngenerally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\\nOn average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover 1 was 9\\nfor Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 . We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales\\nby us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and\\nproduct lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers.\\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as borrowing available\\nunder our credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash\\nneeds and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, \\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity\\nor debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase,\\nrefinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.\\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the\\nacquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity\\nrequirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or\\nfinancing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\\n_______________________\\n(1) Inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing twelve month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarter ends.\\n21\\nPage 22\\nTable of Contents\\nResults of Operations\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. In the first quarter of 2016, we began allocating stock-based\\ncompensation and \\u201cOther operating expense (income), net\\u201d to our segment results. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business\\nperformance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial Statements \\u2014 Note 7 \\u2014 Segment Information.\\u201d\\nNet Sales\\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content\\nwhere we record revenue gross. Service sales represent third-party seller fees earned (including commissions) and related shipping fees, AWS sales, digital content\\nsubscriptions, advertising services, and our co-branded credit card agreements. Amazon Prime membership fees are allocated between product sales and service\\nsales and amortized over the life of the membership according to the estimated delivery of services.

Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon\\nsale of products to our customers.\\nThe increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in Q2 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is\\nprimarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales.\\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as \\u201cTechnology and content\\u201d as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal\\ntechnology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\\nFulfillment\\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment and customer service\\ncenters and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified\\nas \\u201cTechnology and content.\\u201d Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction\\ncosts, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment capacity expansion, the\\nextent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by\\nimplementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment\\ncosts associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction\\n26\\nPage 27\\nTable of Contents\\nand fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales.\\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in Q2 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 , compared to the comparable prior year periods,\\nis primarily due to variable costs corresponding with increased physical and digital product and service sales volume, inventory levels, and sales mix; costs from\\nexpanding fulfillment capacity; and payment processing and related transaction costs.\\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from\\nsales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\\nMarketing\\nWe direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search,\\nportal advertising, email marketing campaigns, direct sales, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and\\nchanges in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would\\nexpect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense.\\nThe increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in Q2 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 , compared to the comparable prior year periods,\\nis primarily due to increased spending on online marketing channels and television and print advertising, as well as payroll and related expenses.\\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective\\nworldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.\\nTechnology and Content\\nTechnology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application,\\nproduction, maintenance, operation, and development for new and existing products and services, as well as AWS and other technology infrastructure expenses.\\nContent costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, and merchandising\\nselection. Digital media content costs related to revenue recorded gross, including Prime Video, are included in cost of sales.\\nWe seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process\\nefficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending\\nprojects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect\\nspending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. The increase in technology and content\\ncosts in absolute dollars in Q2 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 , compared to the comparable prior year periods, is primarily due to increased\\nspending on technology infrastructure principally allocated to our AWS segment, and an increase in payroll and related costs associated with expanding our\\nproducts and services.\\nTechnology infrastructure expenses consist of servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and payroll expenses. These\\ncosts are allocated to segments based on usage. During Q2 2016 , we expanded our technology infrastructure principally by increasing our capacity for AWS\\nservice offerings globally, compared to the comparable prior year period. Additionally, the costs associated with operating and maintaining our expanded\\ninfrastructure have increased over time, corresponding with increased usage. We expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in technology infrastructure\\nto support increased usage.

For the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 , we\\ncapitalized $280 million (including $51 million of stock-based compensation) and $338 million (including $59 million of stock-based compensation) of costs\\nassociated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $160 million and $157 million for Q2 2016\\nand Q2 2015 , and $321 million and $309 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 .\\n27\\nPage 28\\nTable of Contents\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in Q2 2016 and for the six months ended June 30, 2016 , compared to the comparable\\nprior year periods, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses.\\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\\nOther operating expense (income), net was $55 million and $48 million for Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 , and $100 million and $92 million for the six months\\nended June 30, 2016 and 2015 , and was primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets.\\nInterest Income and Expense\\nOur interest income was $24 million and $12 million during Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 , and $45 million and $23 million for the six months ended June 30, 2016\\nand 2015 . We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our\\ninterest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in\\nwhich they are invested.\\nInterest expense was $116 million and $114 million during Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 , and $233 million and $228 million for the six months ended June 30,\\n2016 and 2015 . The increase is primarily due to increases in our long-term debt and capital and finance lease arrangements.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nOther income (expense), net was $(14) million and $0 during Q2 2016 and Q2 2015 , and $66 million and $(131) million for the six months ended June 30,\\n2016 and 2015 . The primary component of other income (expense), net is related to foreign currency and equity warrant gains (losses).\\nIncome Taxes\\nOur tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete\\nitems, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate\\nchanges, we make a cumulative adjustment.\\nOur quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including\\nvariability in accurately predicting our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business,\\nacquisitions (including integrations) and investments, audit-related developments, foreign currency gains (losses), tax law developments (including changes in\\nstatutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices), and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our\\neffective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible\\nexpenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.\\nFor 2016 , our effective tax rate will be favorably affected by the impact of the U.S. federal research and development credit, an increase in amount of pre-\\ntax income relative to income tax expense, an increase in amortization deductions for which we will realize a tax benefit, and a decline in the proportion of\\nnondeductible expenses and losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. We record valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated\\nwith losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. Our effective tax rate will also be adversely affected by state income taxes.

Management\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nForward-Looking Statements\\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All\\nstatements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial\\nposition, made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar\\nexpressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management\\u2019s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual\\nresults could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and\\ncustomer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business\\nopportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with\\nservices, the extent to which we owe income taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and\\nexpansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management, seasonality,\\nthe degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, and risks of fulfillment\\nthroughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks\\nand uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management\\u2019s expectations, are described in greater detail in Item 1A of Part II,\\n\\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d\\nFor additional information, see Item 7 of Part II, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \\u2014 Overview\\u201d of\\nour 2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCritical Accounting Judgments\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The\\nSEC has defined a company\\u2019s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company\\u2019s financial condition and results of\\noperations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are\\ninherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key\\naccounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information,\\nsee Item 8 of Part II, \\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \\u2014 Note 1 \\u2014 Description of Business and Accounting Policies,\\u201d of our 2015 Annual Report\\non Form 10-K and Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial Statements \\u2014 Note 1 \\u2014 Accounting Policies,\\u201d of this Form 10-Q. Although we believe that our estimates,\\nassumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under\\ndifferent assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\\nInventories\\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost or\\nmarket value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as through sales\\nto individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future\\ndisposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. As a\\nmeasure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of March 31, 2016 , we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of\\napproximately $110 million .\\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If\\nwe reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\\nGoodwill\\nWe evaluate goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not be\\nrecoverable. The measurement date of our annual goodwill impairment test is April 1. In testing for goodwill impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative\\nassessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment\\nindicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment\\ntest by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative\\nfactors indicate that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired,\\n16\\nPage 17\\nTable of Contents\\na second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We\\nestimate the fair value of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future net sales and\\noperating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. Certain estimates of\\ndiscounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. Changes in these forecasts could\\nsignificantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.\\nDuring the quarter, management monitored the actual performance of the business relative to the fair value assumptions used during our annual goodwill\\nimpairment test. For the periods presented, no triggering events were identified that required an interim impairment test. As a measure of sensitivity, a 10%\\ndecrease in the fair value of any of our reporting units as of April 1, 2015, would have had no impact on the carrying value of our goodwill.\\nFinancial and credit market volatility directly impacts the fair value measurement through our weighted-average cost of capital that we use to determine a\\ndiscount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. During times of volatility, significant judgment must be applied to\\ndetermine whether credit or stock price changes are short-term in nature or a longer-term trend. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting\\nmethodology used to evaluate goodwill for impairment. Changes in our estimated future cash flows and asset fair values may cause us to realize material\\nimpairment charges in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, a prolonged 20% decrease from our March 31, 2016 closing stock price would not be an indicator of\\npossible impairment.\\nStock-Based Compensation\\nWe measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize it as compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest.\\nThe fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock and the fair value of stock\\noptions is estimated on the date of grant using a Black-Scholes model. The estimated number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the\\nextent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are\\nrevised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including employee level, economic conditions, time remaining to vest, and historical\\nforfeiture experience. We update our estimated forfeiture rate quarterly. We have not made any significant changes to the accounting methodology used to evaluate\\nstock-based compensation. Changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future.\\nAs a measure of sensitivity, a 1% change to our estimated forfeiture rate would have had an approximately $55 million impact on our Q1 2016 operating income.\\nOur estimated forfeiture rate as of March 31, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 , was 28% .\\nWe utilize the accelerated method, rather than the straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. For example, over 50% of the compensation\\ncost related to an award vesting ratably over four years is expensed in the first year. If forfeited early in the life of an award, the compensation expense adjustment\\nis much greater under an accelerated method than under a straight-line method.\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in\\nvarious jurisdictions may be subject to significant change due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is required in evaluating and\\nestimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax\\ndetermination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower\\nstatutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize\\nthe related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses, acquisitions\\n(including integrations) and investments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes in the relevant tax, accounting, and other\\nlaws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals.\\nThe U.S., the European Union and its member states, and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this regard.\\nExcept as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously\\ntaxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S.\\noperations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected.\\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an\\naudit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations\\n17\\nPage 18\\nTable of Contents\\ncould have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent\\nperiods. For instance, the IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in\\n2005 and 2006, and we are currently contesting the matter in U.S. Tax Court. In addition to the risk of additional tax for 2005 and 2006 transactions, if this\\nlitigation is adversely determined or if the IRS were to seek transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature for transactions in subsequent years, we could be\\nsubject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions\\nby the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. If\\nthis matter is adversely resolved, Luxembourg may be required to assess, and we may be required to pay, additional amounts with respect to current and prior\\nperiods and our taxes in the future could increase. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and any\\nrelated litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial Statements \\u2014 Note 1 \\u2014 Accounting Policies \\u2014 Recent Accounting Pronouncements.\\u201d\\n18\\nPage 19\\nTable of Contents\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nCash flow information is as follows (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\\nMarch 31, March 31,\\n2016 2015 2016 2015\\nCash provided by (used in):\\nOperating activities $ (2,160) $ (1,499) $ 11,258 $ 7,845\\nInvesting activities (693) (1,847) (5,296) (5,989)\\nFinancing activities (789) (652) (3,900) 3,955\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair\\nvalue, were $15.9 billion and $19.8 billion as of March 31, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 . Amounts held in foreign currencies were $5.8 billion and $7.3 billion\\nas of March 31, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 , and were primarily Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds.\\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $(2.2) billion and $(1.5) billion for Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 . Our operating cash flows result primarily\\nfrom cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded credit card\\nagreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal use software that are\\nreflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term\\nobligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy\\nfrom us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2016 , compared to the\\ncomparable prior year period, was primarily due to increase in net income (loss), excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based\\ncompensation, offset by changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory\\nmanagement and category expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and\\nwebsite development costs, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of\\nmarketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(693) million and $(1.8) billion for Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 , with the variability caused\\nprimarily by our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities, and changes in cash paid for\\nacquisitions. Cash capital expenditures were $1.2 billion and $871 million during Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 . This primarily reflects additional investments in support\\nof continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS) and additional capacity to support our\\nfulfillment operations. Capital expenditures included $111 million and $129 million for internal-use software and website development during Q1 2016 and Q1\\n2015 . Stock-based compensation capitalized for internal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. We made cash payments, net of\\nacquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $16 million and $365 million during Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 .\\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(789) million and $(652) million for Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 . Cash outflows from financing activities\\nresult from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other. Principal repayments on\\nobligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other were $1.0 billion and $857 million in Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 .\\nProperty and equipment acquired under capital leases was $875 million and $954 million during Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 , reflecting investments in support of\\ncontinued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS. We expect this trend toward additional investment to continue over\\ntime. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and other and tax benefits relating to excess stock-based\\ncompensation deductions. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $9 million and $183 million in Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 . Tax benefits relating to excess\\nstock-based compensation deductions are presented as financing cash flows. Cash inflows from tax benefits related to stock-based compensation deductions were\\n$207 million and $22 million in Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 .\\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under our $2.0 billion Credit Agreement as of March 31, 2016 . See Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial Statements \\u2014 Note 4 \\u2014\\nLong-Term Debt\\u201d for additional information.\\nWe recorded net tax provisions of $475 million and $71 million in Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 . Except as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for\\nU.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings\\nindefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some\\nor all of these undistributed earnings, and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-\\n19\\nPage 20\\nTable of Contents\\nbased compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. In December 2015, U.S.\\nlegislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through 2019. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were $139 million\\nand $55 million for Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 . As of December 31, 2015 , our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $1.1 billion and we had\\napproximately $622 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal\\nresearch and development credit, which was made permanent in 2015. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits, we expect cash paid for taxes\\nto significantly increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis.\\nOur liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for standby and trade letters of credit, guarantees, debt, and real estate\\nleases. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of\\nthose funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from \\u201cCash and cash equivalents\\u201d to restricted cash,\\nwhich is classified within \\u201cAccounts receivable, net and other\\u201d on our consolidated balance sheets. As of March 31, 2016 , and December 31, 2015 , restricted\\ncash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $311 million and $285 million . See Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial Statements \\u2014 Note 3 \\u2014 Commitments and\\nContingencies\\u201d for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Purchase obligations and open purchase orders,\\nconsisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were $6.5 billion as of March 31, 2016 . Purchase obligations and open purchase orders are\\ngenerally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions.\\nOn average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. Inventory turnover 1 was 9\\nfor Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 . We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by several factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales\\nby us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and\\nproduct lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers.\\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as borrowing available\\nunder our credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash\\nneeds and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, \\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity\\nor debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase,\\nrefinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.\\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the\\nacquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity\\nrequirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional lines-of-credit or\\nfinancing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\\n_______________________\\n(1) Inventory turnover is the quotient of trailing twelve month cost of sales to average inventory over five quarter ends.\\n20\\nPage 21\\nTable of Contents\\nResults of Operations\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. In the first quarter of 2016, we began allocating stock-based\\ncompensation and \\u201cOther operating expense (income), net\\u201d to our segment results. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business\\nperformance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial Statements \\u2014 Note 7 \\u2014 Segment Information.\\u201d\\nNet Sales\\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content\\nwhere we record revenue gross.

Shipping costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon\\nsale of products to our customers.\\nThe increase in cost of sales in absolute dollars in Q1 2016 , compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased product and\\nshipping costs resulting from increased sales.\\nCosts to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as \\u201cTechnology and content\\u201d as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal\\ntechnology requirements and external sales to AWS customers.\\nFulfillment\\nFulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment and customer service\\ncenters and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified\\nas \\u201cTechnology and content.\\u201d Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment processing and related transaction\\ncosts, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment capacity expansion, the\\nextent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by\\nimplementing improvements in our operations and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment\\ncosts associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and payment processing and related transaction\\n25\\nPage 26\\nTable of Contents\\nand fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales.\\nThe increase in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in Q1 2016 , compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to variable costs\\ncorresponding with increased physical and digital product and service sales volume, inventory levels, and sales mix; costs from expanding fulfillment capacity; and\\npayment processing and related transaction costs.\\nWe seek to expand our fulfillment capacity to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated shipment volumes from\\nsales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements.\\nMarketing\\nWe direct customers to our websites primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our Associates program, sponsored search,\\nportal advertising, email marketing campaigns, direct sales, and other initiatives. Our marketing expenses are largely variable, based on growth in sales and\\nchanges in rates. To the extent there is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we would\\nexpect to see a corresponding change in our marketing expense.\\nThe increase in marketing costs in absolute dollars in Q1 2016 , compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased spending on\\nonline marketing channels, as well as payroll and related expenses.\\nWhile costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective\\nworldwide marketing tools, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely.\\nTechnology and Content\\nTechnology costs consist principally of research and development activities including payroll and related expenses for employees involved in application,\\nproduction, maintenance, operation, and development for new and existing products and services, as well as AWS and other technology infrastructure expenses.\\nContent costs consist principally of payroll and related expenses for employees involved in category expansion, editorial content, buying, and merchandising\\nselection. Digital media content costs related to revenue recorded gross, including Prime Video, are included in cost of sales.\\nWe seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process\\nefficiency through rapid technology developments while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and capital spending\\nprojects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect\\nspending in technology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. The increase in technology and content\\ncosts in absolute dollars in Q1 2016 , compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increased spending on technology infrastructure principally\\nallocated to our AWS segment, and an increase in payroll and related costs associated with expanding our products and services.\\nTechnology infrastructure expenses consist of servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and payroll expenses. These\\ncosts are allocated to segments based on usage. During Q1 2016 , we expanded our technology infrastructure principally by increasing our capacity for AWS\\nservice offerings globally, compared to the comparable prior year period. Additionally, the costs associated with operating and maintaining our expanded\\ninfrastructure have increased over time, corresponding with increased usage. We expect these trends to continue over time as we invest in technology infrastructure\\nto support increased usage. See Item 7 of Part II, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \\u2014 Overview\\u201d of our\\n2015 Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how management views advances in technology and the importance of innovation.\\nThe increase in payroll and related costs is primarily due to the expansion of existing product categories and service offerings, including AWS, and\\ninitiatives to introduce new product and service offerings.\\nDuring Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 , we capitalized $135 million (including $24 million of stock-based compensation) and $153 million (including $24 million of\\nstock-based compensation) of costs associated with internal-use software and website development. Amortization of previously capitalized amounts was $161\\nmillion and $152 million for Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 .\\nGeneral and Administrative\\nThe increase in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in Q1 2016 , compared to the comparable prior year period, is primarily due to increases\\nin payroll and related expenses.\\n26\\nPage 27\\nTable of Contents\\nOther Operating Expense (Income), Net\\nOther operating expense (income), net was $45 million and $44 million for Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 , and was primarily related to the amortization of\\nintangible assets.\\nInterest Income and Expense\\nOur interest income was $21 million and $11 million during Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 . We generally invest our excess cash in investment grade short- to\\nintermediate-term fixed income securities and AAA-rated money market funds. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based\\non the prevailing rates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested.\\nInterest expense was $117 million and $115 million during Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 . The increase is primarily due to increases in our long-term debt, and\\ncapital and finance lease arrangements.\\nOther Income (Expense), Net\\nOther income (expense), net was $81 million and $(130) million during Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 . The primary component of other income (expense), net is\\nrelated to foreign-currency gains (losses).\\nIncome Taxes\\nOur tax provision or benefit from income taxes for interim periods is determined using an estimate of our annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete\\nitems, if any, that are taken into account in the relevant period. Each quarter we update our estimate of the annual effective tax rate, and if our estimated tax rate\\nchanges, we make a cumulative adjustment.\\nOur quarterly tax provision, and our quarterly estimate of our annual effective tax rate, is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including\\nvariability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes in how we do business, acquisitions (including\\nintegrations) and investments, audit-related developments, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in law, regulations, and administrative practices, and relative\\nchanges of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-\\ntax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.\\nIn 2016 , our effective tax rate will be affected by the adverse impact of nondeductible expenses, state income tax, and losses incurred in certain foreign\\njurisdictions for which we may not realize a related tax benefit, partially offset by the favorable effect of the U.S. federal research and development credit. We\\nexpect a decline in the proportion of losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit in 2016. These losses are primarily due to losses of foreign\\nsubsidiaries, which reduce our pre-tax income without a corresponding reduction in our tax expense, and therefore increase our effective tax rate. We record\\nvaluation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. Our effective tax rate may also be\\nimpacted by the amount of pre-tax income relative to income tax expense and changes in tax law. We will generate income in lower tax jurisdictions primarily\\nrelated to our European operations, which are headquartered in Luxembourg.\\nOur income tax provision was $475 million and $71 million in Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 .\\nEquity-Method Investment Activity, Net of Tax\\nEquity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $(68) million and $(7) million during Q1 2016 and Q1 2015 . The primary components of this activity\\nwere impairments recorded in Q1 2016 and our equity-method investment losses during both periods.\\n27\\nPage 28\\nTable of Contents\\nEffect of Foreign Exchange Rates\\nThe effect on our operating income (loss) from changes in foreign exchange rates versus the U.S. Dollar is as follows (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended March 31,\\n2016 2015\\nAt Prior Exchange At Prior Exchange\\nYear Rate As Year Rate As\\nRates (1) Effect (2) Reported Rates (1) Effect (2) Reported\\nNet sales $ 29,338 $ (210) $ 29,128 $ 24,005 $ (1,288) $ 22,717\\nOperating expenses 28,317 (260) 28,057 23,727 (1,265) 22,462\\nOperating income (loss) 1,021 50 1,071 278 (23) 255\\n___________________\\n(1) Represents the outcome that would have resulted had foreign exchange rates in the reported period been the same as those in effect in the comparable prior\\nyear period for operating results.\\n(2) Represents the increase or decrease in reported amounts resulting from changes in foreign exchange rates from those in effect in the comparable prior year\\nperiod for operating results.\\nThe effect of foreign exchange rates is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Additionally, new product introductions can significantly impact net sales, product costs and operating expenses. Product introductions can also impact\\nthe Company\\u2019s net sales to its indirect distribution channels as these channels are filled with new product inventory following a product introduction, and often,\\nchannel inventory of a particular product declines as the next related major product launch approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and\\ndistributors anticipate a product introduction. However, neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered\\nreliable indicators of the Company\\u2019s future pattern of product introductions, future net sales or financial performance.\\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2016 Highlights\\nNet sales grew 2% or $1.3 billion during the first quarter of 2016 compared to the first quarter of 2015, primarily driven by strong growth in Other Products and in\\nServices, partially offset by lower iPad net sales. Additionally, the effect of weakness in most foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar negatively impacted the\\nCompany\\u2019s net sales. Other Products and Services net sales increased in all of the Company\\u2019s reportable operating segments.\\nDuring the first quarter of 2016, the Company released OS X El Capitan, its 12 th major release of OS X, and its new tvOS\\u2122 operating system.

The foregoing statement regarding the Company\\u2019s\\nexpected gross margin percentage in the second quarter of 2016 is forward-looking and could differ from actual results. The Company\\u2019s future gross margins\\ncan be impacted by multiple factors including, but not limited to, those set forth in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q under the heading \\u201cRisk Factors\\u201d and those\\ndescribed in this paragraph. In general, the Company believes gross margins will remain under downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including\\ncontinued industry wide global product pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, product transitions, potential increases in the\\ncost of components, and potential strengthening of the U.S. dollar, as well as potential increases in the costs of outside manufacturing services and a potential\\nshift in the Company\\u2019s sales mix towards products with lower gross margins. In response to competitive pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take\\nproduct pricing actions, which would adversely affect gross margins. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company\\u2019s ability to manage product quality\\nand warranty costs effectively and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. Due to the Company\\u2019s significant international operations, its financial\\ncondition and operating results, including gross margins, could be significantly affected by fluctuations in exchange rates.\\nOperating Expenses\\nOperating expenses for the first quarter of 2016 and 2015 were as follows (dollars in millions):\\nThree Months Ended\\nDecember 26, 2015 December 27, 2014 Change\\nResearch and development $ 2,404 $ 1,895 27%\\nPercentage of total net sales 3% 3%\\nSelling, general and administrative $ 3,848 $ 3,600 7%\\nPercentage of total net sales 5% 5%\\nTotal operating expenses $ 6,252 $ 5,495 14%\\nPercentage of total net sales 8% 7%\\nResearch and Development\\nThe year-over-year increase in R&D expense during the first quarter of 2016 was driven primarily by an increase in headcount and related expenses, including\\nshare-based compensation costs, and material costs to support expanded R&D activities.

The Company believes\\nthe European Commission\\u2019s assertions are without merit. If the European Commission were to conclude against Ireland, the European Commission could\\nrequire Ireland to recover from the Company past taxes covering a period of up to 10 years reflective of the disallowed state aid. While such amount could be\\nmaterial, as of December 26, 2015 the Company is unable to estimate the impact.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nIn January 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\\u201cFASB\\u201d) issued Accounting Standards Update (\\u201cASU\\u201d) No. 2016-01, Financial Instruments \\u2013 Overall\\n(Subtopic 825-10) (\\u201cASU 2016-01\\u201d), which updates certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments.

The Company does not believe the adoption\\nof the new financial instruments standard will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\\nIn May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) (\\u201cASU 2014-09\\u201d), which amends the existing accounting\\nstandards for revenue recognition. ASU 2014-09 is based on principles that govern the recognition of revenue at an amount an entity expects to be entitled when\\nproducts are transferred to customers.\\nThe original effective date for ASU 2014-09 would have required the Company to adopt beginning in its first quarter of 2018. In August 2015, the FASB issued\\nASU No. 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) \\u2013 Deferral of the Effective Date, which defers the effective date of ASU 2014-09 for one\\nyear and permits early adoption as early as the original effective date of ASU 2014-09. Accordingly, the Company may adopt the standard in either its first\\nquarter of 2018 or 2019. The new revenue standard may be applied retrospectively to each prior period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect\\nrecognized as of the date of adoption. The Company is currently evaluating the timing of its adoption and the impact of adopting the new revenue standard on its\\nconsolidated financial statements.\\n28\\nPage 29\\nTable of Contents\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nThe following tables present selected financial information and statistics as of and during the three months ended December 26, 2015 and September 26, 2015\\n(in millions):\\nDecember 26, 2015 September 26, 2015\\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 215,739 $ 205,666\\nProperty, plant and equipment, net $ 22,300 $ 22,471\\nCommercial paper $ 7,259 $ 8,499\\nTotal term debt $ 55,704 $ 55,963\\nWorking capital $ 127 $ 8,768\\nThree Months Ended\\nDecember 26, 2015 December 27, 2014\\nCash generated by operating activities $ 27,463 $ 33,722\\nCash used in investing activities $ (20,450) $ (21,165)\\nCash used in financing activities $ (11,444) $ (6,923)\\nThe Company believes its existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital needs, capital\\nasset purchases, outstanding commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with its existing operations over the next 12 months.

MANAGEMENT\\u2019S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF\\nOPERATIONS\\nThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the\\naccompanying notes included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\nOverview\\nOur mission is to accelerate the world\\u2019s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture, lease and sell\\nhigh-performance fully electric vehicles, solar energy generation systems and energy storage products. We also offer maintenance,\\ninstallation, operation and other services related to our products.\\nAutomotive\\nOur production vehicle fleet includes our Model S premium sedan and our Model X sport utility vehicle, which are our\\nhighest-performance vehicles, and our Model 3, a lower-priced sedan designed for the mass market which we began to produce and\\ndeliver in the second half of 2017. We continue to enhance our vehicle offerings with enhanced Autopilot options, Internet\\nconnectivity and free over-the-air software updates to provide additional safety, convenience and performance features. In addition,\\nwe have several future electric vehicles in our product pipeline, including those we unveiled in 2017 \\u2013 an electric semi-truck and a\\nnew version of the Tesla Roadster.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage\\nWe lease and sell solar energy systems and sell renewable energy and energy storage products to our customers. We have\\npartnered with Panasonic to provide capital and operational support to manufacture PV cells, thus enabling high volume integrated\\ntile and PV cell production at our Gigafactory 2 in Buffalo, New York. We are also continuing to iterate on our Solar Roof product\\ndesign and production and installation processes before ramping production to a higher level at Gigafactory 2. Our energy storage\\nproducts, which we manufacture at Gigafactory 1, consist of Powerwall, mostly for residential applications, and Powerpack, for\\ncommercial, industrial and utility-scale applications.\\nManagement Opportunities, Challenges and Risks\\nAutomotive Demand, Production and Deliveries\\nWe drive demand for our vehicles by continually improving our vehicles through over-the-air software updates, expanding\\nour retail, service and charging infrastructure, and by periodically developing and introducing new passenger and commercial\\nelectric vehicle variants and models. Our goal is to produce the world\\u2019s highest quality vehicles as quickly and as cost-effectively\\nas possible with a priority on workplace health and safety. The worldwide automotive markets for alternative fuel vehicles and self-\\ndriving technology are highly competitive and we expect them to become even more so. A growing number of companies,\\nincluding established automakers, have announced plans to expand, and in some cases fully transition to, production of electric or\\nenvironmentally friendly vehicles, and/or to develop self-driving technologies.\\nNevertheless, we believe that the unique features of our vehicles, our constant innovation, our growing brand, the increased\\naffordability introduced with Model 3, our global Supercharger network and our future vehicles will continue to generate\\nincremental demand for our vehicles by making our vehicles accessible to larger and previously untapped consumer and\\ncommercial markets. For example, we recently expanded our Model 3 offerings by commencing production of the performance-\\nlevel trim of the dual motor all-wheel drive version of Model 3, and we plan to add less expensive variants, begin deliveries outside\\nof North America and offer leasing options. We also commenced Model 3 test drives and moved to a direct order system for this\\nvehicle in North America, and vehicles are now being ordered by both existing reservation holders and customers without prior\\nreservations.\\nWe produced more than 5,000 Model 3 vehicles during the last week of June 2018, and repeated the production of\\napproximately 5,000 Model 3 vehicles in a week multiple times during July 2018. Although we experienced certain challenges\\nramping our main Model 3 general assembly line, the simplicity of the Model 3 architecture allowed us to quickly build a second\\nModel 3 general assembly line with a resulting vehicle quality and cost of production roughly equal to those of the main general\\nassembly line. We are continuing to make progress on the main Model 3 general assembly line and evolve the second general\\nassembly line, and at our current point in the ramp we have maintained a high level of automation in our other manufacturing\\nprocesses, including stamping, body welding, paint shop, powertrain assembly and battery pack assembly. Accordingly, while\\nkeeping our capital expenditures limited, our aim is to further increase production to a rate of 6,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by\\nlate August 2018, then beyond that rate over the next few quarters, and ultimately to a rate of 10,000 vehicles per week by\\nsometime in 2019. Indeed, we believe that the majority of our Model 3 production processes will be capable of producing 10,000\\nvehicles per week by the end of 2018, but achieving that rate will require that we increase capacity in certain production processes\\nand that our suppliers ramp further. Moreover, it is to be expected that additional bottlenecks will arise as we continue to ramp, and\\nit will be important that we address them promptly.\\n33\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459018019254/tsla-10q_20180630.htm 35/75\\nPage 36\\n6/1/24, 9:16 PM tsla-10q_20180630.htm\\nWe continue to expect Model S and Model X deliveries to be approximately 100,000 in total in 2018, constrained by the total\\navailable supply of cells with the 18650 form factor used in those vehicles. As our sales network continues to expand to new\\nmarkets, we believe vehicle orders should continue to grow. With demand outpacing production, we plan to optimize the trim and\\noption mix in order to optimize revenue and gross margin. We have made significant and sustained progress in the production\\nprocesses of Model S and Model X, and we will continue to improve manufacturing efficiencies for these vehicles in 2018.\\nWe are also making strides in other aspects of our vehicle production, deliveries and customer infrastructure. For example,\\nwe expect to continue to lower the cost of manufacturing our vehicles due to economies of scale, material cost reductions and more\\nefficient manufacturing and equipment utilization. We have achieved cost improvements through material cost reductions from\\nboth engineering and commercial actions and increased manufacturing efficiencies including better inventory control for Model S\\nand Model X. We have also seen improved product reliability in our vehicles, batteries and drive units. We are also realigning and\\nstreamlining our delivery process to ensure that each delivery session is informative, convenient and quick, and that the overall\\nflow of deliveries is both scalable at volume and more linear throughout each quarter rather than back-ended toward the end of\\neach quarter. We believe this change will provide a better customer experience and reduce the stress on our delivery system. As\\nsales of Tesla vehicles ramp further, we plan to continue to open new Tesla retail, locations, service centers and delivery hubs\\naround the world, we plan to continue to expand our Mobile Service fleet, and we plan to significantly increase the number of\\nSuperchargers and Destination Charging connectors globally as the Model 3 fleet continues to grow.\\nIn July 2018, we delivered our 200,000th vehicle in the U.S. Under current regulations, the full $7,500 federal tax credit for\\nthe purchase of a qualified electric vehicle will continue to be available only for any of our new vehicles delivered by the end of\\n2018 in the U.S., and then will be reduced to $3,750 for each vehicle delivered by the end of the second quarter of 2019, then to\\n$1,875 for each vehicle delivered by the end of 2019, then to $0 for each vehicle delivered thereafter. In the near term, we believe\\nthis phase-out will pull forward customer orders, before normalizing. In the long run, we do not expect a meaningful impact to our\\nsales in the U.S., as we believe that our vehicles offer a compelling proposition at their full price.\\nMoreover, we recently adjusted our vehicle pricing in China in order to partially offset tariffs on vehicle imports to China\\nfrom the U.S., which increased to 40%. While this adjustment may have some negative impact on our vehicle sales in China in the\\nnear term, we do not expect our global vehicle deliveries to be heavily impacted since we will partially divert deliveries to North\\nAmerica and Europe if necessary.\\nFinally, we continue to make progress with our self-driving technology. Our neural net and functionality continue to improve,\\nand we frequently release minor software updates and from time to time release significant version updates, including most\\nrecently in March 2018. While we are subject to regulatory constraints over which we have no control, our ultimate goal is to\\nachieve full autonomy.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Demand, Production and Deployment\\nWe are continuing to reduce customer acquisition costs of our energy generation products, including by cutting advertising\\nspend and shifting our sales strategy significantly in the second quarter of 2018 to sell these products exclusively in Tesla stores\\nwith dedicated energy product sales personnel and on our website. As we implement this strategy, we expect that our solar\\ndeployments will remain stable in the short term before growing, including through cross-selling opportunities to our expanding\\nbase of vehicle owners. Our emphasis for retrofit solar products remains on executing projects for upfront cash generation and\\nprofitability, rather than absolute volume growth.\\nWe are steadily ramping Solar Roof production at Gigafactory 2 and are also continuing to iterate on the product design and\\nproduction process with learnings from our manufacturing and field installation experience to date, including units deployed during\\nthe second quarter of 2018. After we simplify the production and installation processes, we plan to increase automation at\\nGigafactory 2 and further ramp production toward the end of 2018.\\nWe expect energy storage products to experience significant growth, with our aim being to at least triple deployments in\\n2018. We are ramping up production for these products at our Gigafactory 1 over the next several quarters, but demand is greater\\nthan our current production capacity for energy storage. For example, even as our energy storage business in May 2018 reached a\\nsignificant milestone of 1 gigawatt hour deployed in total since inception, our net backlog continued to grow in the second quarter\\nof 2018.\\nTrends in Cash Flow, Capital Expenditures and Operating Expenses\\nCapital expenditures in 2018 are expected to support increases in Model 3 production capacity at Gigafactory 1 and the Tesla\\nFactory, and for building additional stores, service centers and Superchargers. However, we have significantly reduced our\\nprojections for capital expenditures by focusing on the critical near-term needs that will benefit us primarily in the next two years.\\nAt this stage, we are expecting total 2018 capital expenditures to be slightly below $2.5 billion. Ultimately, our capital expenditures\\nwill develop in line with Model 3 production, our profitability and our operating cash generation.\\n34\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459018019254/tsla-10q_20180630.htm 36/75\\nPage 37\\n6/1/24, 9:16 PM tsla-10q_20180630.htm\\nWe incurred certain costs in the second quarter of 2018 in connection with a significant cost restructuring. In addition, we\\nexpect operating expenses to grow in 2018 as compared to 2017, although operating expenses should decrease significantly as a\\npercentage of revenue due to the significant increase in expected revenue in 2018 and as we focus on increasing operational\\nefficiency. The growth in operating expense will mainly be driven by engineering, design and testing of new products or changes to\\nexisting products and higher sales and service costs associated with expanding our worldwide geographic presence. In addition, we\\nexpect operating expenses to increase as a result of increased selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by our energy\\ngeneration and storage business.\\nIn March 2018, our stockholders approved a new 10-year CEO performance award for Elon Musk with vesting contingent on\\nachieving market capitalization and operational milestones. Consequently, we may incur significant additional non-cash stock-\\nbased compensation expense over the term of the award as each operational milestone becomes probable of vesting.\\nAutomotive Financing Options\\nWe offer loans and leases for our vehicles in certain markets in North America, Europe and Asia primarily through various\\nfinancial institutions. We offered resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to all direct customers who purchase vehicles\\nand who financed their vehicle through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Subsequent to June 30, 2016, this\\nprogram is available only in certain international markets. Resale value guarantees available for exercise within the 12 months\\nfollowing June 30, 2018 totaled $139.3 million in value.\\nWe have adopted the new revenue recognition standard ASC 606 effective January 1, 2018. This impacts the way we account\\nfor vehicle sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased through our leasing partners, which now generally qualify to be\\naccounted for as sales with a right of return. In addition, for certain vehicles sales with a resale value guarantee and vehicles leased\\nthrough leasing partners prior to 2018, we have ceased recognizing lease revenue starting in 2018 and now record the associated\\ncumulative adjustment to equity under the modified retrospective approach.\\nVehicle deliveries with the resale value guarantee do not impact our near-term cash flows and liquidity, since we receive the\\nfull amount of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery. While we do not assume any credit risk related to the customer, if a\\ncustomer exercises the option to return the vehicle to us, we are exposed to liquidity risk that the resale value of vehicles under\\nthese programs may be lower than our guarantee, or the volume of vehicles returned to us may be higher than our estimates or we\\nmay be unable to resell the used vehicles in a timely manner, all of which could adversely impact our cash flows. Through 2017,\\nwe only had an insignificant number of customers who exercised their resale value guarantees and returned their vehicles to us.\\nBased on current market demand for our vehicles, we estimate the resale prices for our vehicles will continue to be above our resale\\nvalue guarantee amounts. Should market values of our vehicles or customer demand decrease, these estimates may be impacted\\nmaterially.\\nWe currently offer vehicle leases in the U.S. for Model S and Model X directly from Tesla Finance, our captive financing\\nentity. Leasing through Tesla Finance is available in 39 states and the District of Columbia. We also offer financing arrangements\\nthrough our entities in Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom. We also offer leasing through leasing partners in certain\\njurisdictions. Leasing through our captive financing entities and our leasing partners exposes us to residual value risk. In addition,\\nfor leases offered directly from our captive financing entities, we assume customer credit risk. We plan to continue expanding our\\nfinancing offerings, including our lease financing options and the financial sources to support them, and to support the overall\\nfinancing needs of our customers. To the extent that we are unable to arrange such options for our customers on terms that are\\nattractive, our sales, financial results and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\\nEnergy Generation and Storage Financing Options\\nWe offer our customers the choice to either purchase and own solar energy systems or to purchase the energy that our solar\\nenergy systems produce through various contractual arrangements. These contractual arrangements include long-term leases and\\npower purchase agreements. In both structures, we install our solar energy systems at our customer\\u2019s premises and charge the\\ncustomer a monthly fee. In the lease structure, this monthly payment is fixed with a minimum production guarantee. In the power\\npurchase agreement structure, we charge customers a fee per kilowatt-hour, or kWh, based on the amount of electricity the solar\\nenergy system actually produces. The leases and power purchase agreements are typically for 20 years with a renewal option, and\\ngenerally when there is no upfront prepayment, the specified monthly fees are subject to annual escalations.\\nFor customers who want to purchase and own solar energy systems, we also offer solar loans, whereby a third-party lender\\nprovides financing directly to a qualified customer to enable the customer to purchase and own a solar energy system designed,\\ninstalled and serviced by us. We enter into a standard solar energy system sale and installation agreement with the customer.\\nSeparately, the customer enters into a loan agreement with a third-party lender, who finances the full purchase price. We are not a\\nparty to the loan agreement between the customer and the third-party lender, and the third-party lender has no recourse against us\\nwith respect to the loan.\\n35\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459018019254/tsla-10q_20180630.htm 37/75\\nPage 38\\n6/1/24, 9:16 PM tsla-10q_20180630.htm\\nGigafactory 1\\nWe continue to develop Gigafactory 1 as a facility where we work together with our suppliers to integrate production of\\nbattery material, cells, modules, battery packs and drive units in one location for vehicles and energy storage products. We also\\ncontinue to invest in the future expansion of Gigafactory 1 and in production equipment for battery cell, module and pack\\nproduction.\\nPanasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory 1 with investments in the production equipment that it uses to manufacture\\nand supply us with battery cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output from their production\\nequipment at negotiated prices. As these terms convey to us the right to use, as defined in ASC 840, Leases, their production\\nequipment, we consider them to be leased assets when production commences. This results in us recording the value of their\\nproduction equipment within property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability\\nrecorded to financing obligations. For all suppliers and partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production\\nequipment located at Gigafactory 1, we will apply similar accounting. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2018, we\\nrecorded additions of $379.0 million and $482.0 million, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets.\\nWhile we currently believe that our progress at Gigafactory 1 will allow us to reach our production targets, our ultimate\\nability to do so will require us to resolve the types of challenges that are typical of a production ramp and the operation of a world-\\nclass manufacturing facility. For example, in the past we experienced bottlenecks in the assembly of battery modules at Gigafactory\\n1, which negatively affected our production of Model 3. Given the size and complexity of this undertaking, it is possible that future\\nevents could result in the cost of building and operating Gigafactory 1 exceeding our current expectations and Gigafactory 1 taking\\nlonger to expand than we currently anticipate.\\nGigafactory 2\\nWe have an agreement with the SUNY Foundation for the construction of a factory capable of producing at least\\n1.0 gigawatts of solar cells annually in Buffalo, New York, referred to as Gigafactory 2. In December 2016, we entered into an\\nagreement with Panasonic under which it manufactures custom PV cells and modules for us, primarily at Gigafactory 2, and we\\nwill purchase certain quantities of PV cells and modules from Panasonic during the 10-year term.\\nThe terms of our agreement with the SUNY Foundation require us to comply with a number of covenants, and any failure to\\ncomply with these covenants could obligate us to pay significant amounts to the SUNY Foundation and result in termination of the\\nagreement. Although we have commenced production at Gigafactory 2, our expectations as to the cost of building the facility,\\nacquiring manufacturing equipment and supporting our manufacturing operations may prove incorrect, which could subject us to\\nsignificant expenses to achieve the desired benefits.\\nOther Manufacturing\\nIn addition, we continue to expand production capacity at our Tesla Factory and are exploring additional production capacity\\ninternationally. For example, in July 2018, we announced a plan to build Gigafactory 3 in Shanghai, China to manufacture vehicles\\nand battery packs for China, the largest electric vehicle market in the world.\\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the\\nUnited States (\\u201cGAAP\\u201d). The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions\\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and the related disclosures. We base our\\nestimates on historical experience, as appropriate, and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the\\ncircumstances. Changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period. Accordingly, actual\\nresults could differ significantly from the estimates made by us. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an on-going basis.\\nTo the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results, the future financial statement\\npresentation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be affected.\\nFor a description of our critical accounting policies and estimates, refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting\\nPolicies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\\n36\\nhttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data//1318605/000156459018019254/tsla-10q_20180630.htm 38/75\\nPage 39\\n6/1/24, 9:16 PM tsla-10q_20180630.htm\\nResults of Operations\\nRevenues\\nThree Months Ended June 30, Change Six Months Ended June 30, Change\\n(Dollars in thousands) 2018 2017 $ % 2018 2017 $ %\\nAutomotive sales $ 3,117,865 $2,013,852 $1,104,013 55% $5,679,746 $4,048,912 $1,630,834 40%\\nAutomotive leasing 239,816 272,764 (32,948) -12% 413,252 527,304 (114,052) -22%\\nTotal automotive\\nrevenues 3,357,681 2,286,616 1,071,065 47% 6,092,998 4,576,216 1,516,782 33%\\nServices and other 270,142 216,161 53,981 25% 533,554 408,887 124,667 30%\\nTotal automotive &\\nservices and other\\nsegment revenue 3,627,823 2,502,777 1,125,046 45% 6,626,552 4,985,103 1,641,449 33%\\nEnergy generation and\\nstorage segment revenue 374,408 286,780 87,628 31% 784,430 500,724 283,706 57%\\nTotal revenues $4,002,231 $2,789,557 $1,212,674 43% $7,410,982 $5,485,827 $1,925,155 35%\\nAutomotive & Services and Other Segment\\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to sale of new Model S, Model X and Model 3 vehicles, including\\ninternet connectivity, Supercharger access, and specified software updates for cars equipped with autopilot hardware, as well as\\nsales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers.\\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for Model S and Model X vehicles under direct lease\\nagreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting.

On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of appeal to the\\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or if\\nthe IRS were to successfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to\\nsignificant additional tax liabilities.\\nCertain of our subsidiaries are under examination or investigation or may be subject to examination or investigation by the French Tax Administration\\n(\\u201cFTA\\u201d) for calendar year 2006 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes. In September\\n2012, we received proposed tax assessment notices for calendar years 2006 through 2010 relating to the allocation of income between foreign jurisdictions. In June\\n2015, we received final tax collection notices for these years assessing additional French tax of \\u20ac196 million , including interest and penalties through September\\n2012. We disagree with the assessment and intend to contest it vigorously. We plan to pursue all available administrative remedies, and if we are not able to\\nresolve this matter, we plan to pursue judicial remedies. In addition to the risk of additional tax for years 2006 through 2010, if this litigation is adversely\\ndetermined or if the FTA were to seek adjustments of a similar nature for subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In addition,\\nin October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the\\ncorporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced\\nits decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. This decision orders Luxembourg to\\ncalculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision to be without merit and will consider our legal\\noptions, including an appeal. While the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately \\u20ac250 million , plus interest, the actual\\namount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the European Commission\\u2019s guidance.\\nOnce the recovery amount is computed by Luxembourg, we anticipate funding it, including interest, into escrow, where it will remain pending conclusion of all\\nappeals. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including Canada, China, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, and\\nthe United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular\\njurisdictions primarily for 2008 and thereafter.\\nNote 8 \\u2014 SEGMENT INFORMATION\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses\\n\\u201cFulfillment,\\u201d \\u201cMarketing,\\u201d \\u201cTechnology and content,\\u201d and \\u201cGeneral and administrative\\u201d based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the\\ncosts are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-\\ninfrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. In Q1 2017, we combined stock-based compensation and\\n\\u201cOther operating expense, net\\u201d with operating expenses in our presentation of segment results. While we continue to evaluate the integration of Whole Foods\\nMarket within our segments, we have included Whole Foods Market in our North America and International segments based on physical location. There are no\\ninternal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company\\u2019s\\nbusiness performance and manages its operations.\\nNorth America\\nThe North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through\\nNorth America-focused websites, such as www.amazon.com, www.amazon.ca, and www.amazon.com.mx, and physical stores. This segment includes export sales\\nfrom these websites.\\nInternational\\nThe International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through\\ninternationally-focused websites such as www.amazon.com.au, www.amazon.com.br, www.amazon.cn, www.amazon.fr, www.amazon.de, www.amazon.in,\\nwww.amazon.it, www.amazon.co.jp, www.amazon.nl, www.amazon.es, and www.amazon.co.uk.

Management\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\\nForward-Looking Statements\\nThis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All\\nstatements other than statements of historical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or financial\\nposition, made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are forward-looking. We use words such as anticipates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar\\nexpressions to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements reflect management\\u2019s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual\\nresults could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, changes in global economic conditions and\\ncustomer spending, world events, the rate of growth of the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business\\nopportunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of net sales derived from products as compared with\\nservices, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth\\nand expansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center optimization, risks of inventory management,\\nseasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and develop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions,\\npayments risks, and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. These risks and\\nuncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ significantly from management\\u2019s expectations, are described in\\ngreater detail in Item 1A of Part II, \\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d\\nFor additional information, see Item 7 of Part II, \\u201cManagement\\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations \\u2014 Overview\\u201d of\\nour 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\\nCritical Accounting Judgments\\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and\\nliabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The\\nSEC has defined a company\\u2019s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company\\u2019s financial condition and results of\\noperations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are\\ninherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key\\naccounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to understanding our results. For additional information,\\nsee Item 8 of Part II, \\u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data \\u2014 Note 1 \\u2014 Description of Business and Accounting Policies,\\u201d of our 2016 Annual Report\\non Form 10-K and Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial Statements \\u2014 Note 1 \\u2014 Accounting Policies,\\u201d of this Form 10-Q. Although we believe that our estimates,\\nassumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under\\ndifferent assumptions, judgments, or conditions.\\nInventories\\nInventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and\\nnet realizable value. This valuation requires us to make judgments, based on currently-available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as\\nthrough sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions\\nabout future disposition of inventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the\\nfuture. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of September 30, 2017 , we would have recorded an additional cost\\nof sales of approximately $150 million .\\nIn addition, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If\\nwe reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs.\\n21\\nPage 22\\nTable of Contents\\nIncome Taxes\\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, and administrative practices in\\nvarious jurisdictions may be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment is\\nrequired in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for\\nwhich the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have\\nlower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to\\nrealize the related tax benefit, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, entry into new businesses and geographies and changes to our existing businesses,\\nacquisitions (including integrations) and investments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, and changes\\nin the relevant tax, accounting, and other laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations, including fundamental changes to the tax laws\\napplicable to corporate multinationals. The U.S., the European Union and its member states, and a number of other countries are actively pursuing changes in this\\nregard.\\nExcept as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that have not been previously\\ntaxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are needed for our U.S.\\noperations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings and our effective tax rate would be adversely affected.\\nWe are also currently subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Developments in an\\naudit, litigation, or the relevant laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations could have a material effect on our operating results or\\ncash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. For instance, the IRS is seeking to increase our\\nU.S. taxable income related to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries for transactions undertaken in 2005 and 2006, and we have been contesting the matter\\nin U.S. Tax Court. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decision regarding the issues raised in the IRS Notices of Proposed Adjustment (\\u201cNOPAs\\u201d).\\nThe Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions undertaken with our\\nforeign subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. On September 29, 2017, the IRS filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals\\nfor the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or if the IRS were to\\nsuccessfully assert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could be subject to significant additional\\ntax liabilities. In addition, in October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in\\nLuxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the\\nEuropean Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid.\\nThis decision orders Luxembourg to calculate and recover additional taxes from us for the period May 2006 through June 2014. We believe this decision to be\\nwithout merit and will consider our legal options, including an appeal. While the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of\\napproximately \\u20ac250 million, plus interest, the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in\\naccordance with the European Commission\\u2019s guidance. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of tax audits, investigations, and\\nany related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.\\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\\nSee Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial Statements \\u2014 Note 1 \\u2014 Accounting Policies.\\u201d\\n22\\nPage 23\\nTable of Contents\\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\\nCash flow information, which reflects retrospective adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows as described in Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial\\nStatements \\u2014 Note 1 \\u2014 Accounting Policies,\\u201d is as follows (in millions):\\nThree Months Ended Nine Months Ended Twelve Months Ended\\nSeptember 30, September 30, September 30,\\n2016 2017 2016 2017 2016 2017\\nCash provided by (used in):\\nOperating activities $ 4,659 $ 3,851 $ 6,284 $ 6,090 $ 15,004 $ 17,077\\nInvesting activities (2,570) (19,120) (5,702) (25,787) (7,552) (29,961)\\nFinancing activities (1,000) 14,685 (3,148) 12,507 (4,746) 11,916\\nOur principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair\\nvalue, were $26.0 billion and $24.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 , and September 30, 2017 . Amounts held in foreign currencies were $9.1 billion and $7.8\\nbillion as of December 31, 2016 , and September 30, 2017 , and were primarily Euros, Japanese Yen, and British Pounds.\\nCash provided by (used in) operating activities was $4.7 billion and $3.9 billion for Q3 2016 and Q3 2017 , and $6.3 billion and $6.1 billion for the nine\\nmonths ended September 30, 2016 and 2017 . Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and\\ncontent creator customers, advertising agreements, and our co-branded credit card agreements, offset by cash payments we make for products and services,\\nemployee compensation (less amounts capitalized related to internal-use software that are reflected as cash used in investing activities), payment processing and\\nrelated transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from our customers and other activities generally\\ncorresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in\\noperating cash flow for the trailing twelve months ended September 30, 2017 , compared to the comparable prior year period, was primarily due to the increase in\\nnet income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities is also\\nsubject to changes in working capital. Working capital at any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and\\ncategory expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\\nCash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures, including leasehold improvements, internal-use software and\\nwebsite development costs, cash outlays for acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and maturities of\\nmarketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(2.6) billion and $(19.1) billion for Q3 2016 and Q3 2017 , and $(5.7) billion and\\n$(25.8) billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017 , with the variability caused primarily by cash paid for acquisitions, our decision to\\npurchase or lease property and equipment, and purchases, maturities, and sales of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $1.8 billion and $2.7\\nbillion during Q3 2016 and Q3 2017 , and $4.7 billion and $7.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017 , which primarily reflect additional\\ncapacity to support our fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth due to investments in technology infrastructure\\n(the majority of which is to support AWS). Capital expenditures included $97 million and $71 million for internal-use software and website development during\\nQ3 2016 and Q3 2017 , and $326 million and $235 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017 . Stock-based compensation capitalized for\\ninternal-use software and website development costs does not affect cash flows. We made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other\\ninvestment activity of $84 million and $13.2 billion during Q3 2016 and Q3 2017 , and $113 million and $13.9 billion for the nine months ended September 30,\\n2016 and 2017 .\\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(1.0) billion and $14.7 billion for Q3 2016 and Q3 2017 , and $(3.1) billion and $12.5 billion for the\\nnine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017 . Cash outflows from financing activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases\\nand finance leases and repayments of long-term debt and other. Principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of\\nlong-term debt and other were $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion in Q3 2016 and Q3 2017 , and $3.2 billion and $3.7 billion for the nine months ended September 30,\\n2016 and 2017 . Property and equipment acquired under capital leases was $1.4 billion and $2.3 billion during Q3 2016 and Q3 2017 , and $3.7 billion and $6.9\\nbillion for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017 , reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily due to investments in\\ntechnology infrastructure for AWS, which investments we expect to continue over time. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from\\nlong-term debt and other. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were $8 million and $16.1 billion in Q3 2016 and Q3 2017 , and $83 million and $16.2 billion\\nfor the nine months ended September 30, 2016 and 2017 . During 2017, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of\\n$16.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in seven tranches maturing in 2020 through 2057. The proceeds from the August 2017 Notes were used to fund the\\nconsideration for the\\n23\\nPage 24\\nTable of Contents\\nacquisition of Whole Foods Market and will be used to repay the 1.200% Notes due 2017 and for general corporate purposes. See Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cNotes to\\nConsolidated Financial Statements \\u2014 Note 5 \\u2014 Long-Term Debt\\u201d for additional discussion of the Notes.\\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under our Credit Agreement and $550 million of borrowings outstanding under our Credit Facility as of September 30,\\n2017 . See Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial Statements \\u2014 Note 5 \\u2014 Long-Term Debt\\u201d for additional information.\\nWe recorded net tax provisions of $229 million and $58 million in Q3 2016 and Q3 2017 , and $1.0 billion and $755 million for the nine months ended\\nSeptember 30, 2016 and 2017 . Except as required under U.S. tax laws, we do not provide for U.S. taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that\\nhave not been previously taxed since we intend to invest such undistributed earnings indefinitely outside of the U.S. If our intent changes or if these funds are\\nneeded for our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue or pay U.S. taxes on some or all of these undistributed earnings, and our effective tax rate would be\\nadversely affected. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to\\nreduce our U.S. taxable income. In December 2015, U.S. legislation was enacted that extended accelerated depreciation deductions on qualifying property through\\n2019. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds were $91 million and $172 million for Q3 2016 and Q3 2017 , and $317 million and $865 million for the nine months ended\\nSeptember 30, 2016 and 2017 . As of December 31, 2016 , our federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $76 million and we had approximately\\n$608 million of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and\\ndevelopment credit. We expect cash paid for taxes to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis.\\nIn connection with its October 2017 decision against us on state aid, the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately \\u20ac250\\nmillion, plus interest. The actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery is to be calculated by the Luxembourg tax authorities in accordance with the\\nEuropean Commission's guidance. Once the recovery amount is computed by Luxembourg, we anticipate funding it, including interest, into escrow, where it will\\nremain pending conclusion of all appeals.\\nOur liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, workers\\u2019 compensation obligations, amounts due\\nto third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer certain\\ntypes of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of\\nour cash and cash equivalents from \\u201cCash and cash equivalents\\u201d to restricted cash, which is classified within \\u201cAccounts receivable, net and other\\u201d on our\\nconsolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2016 , and September 30, 2017 , restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $600 million\\nand $1.2 billion . See Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial Statements \\u2014 Note 3 \\u2014 Commitments and Contingencies\\u201d for additional discussion of our principal contractual\\ncommitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory\\ncommitments, were $15.5 billion as of September 30, 2017 . These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or in part\\nthrough the contractual provisions.\\nWe believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as borrowing available\\nunder our credit agreements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash\\nneeds and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part II, \\u201cRisk Factors.\\u201d We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity\\nor debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase,\\nrefinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position.\\nThe sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the\\nacquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity\\nrequirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or\\nfinancing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\\n24\\nPage 25\\nTable of Contents\\nResults of Operations\\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. Our results reflect the operations of Whole Foods Market\\nfrom the date of acquisition. In Q1 2017, we combined stock-based compensation and \\u201cOther operating expense, net\\u201d with operating expenses in our presentation\\nof segment results. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 1 of Part I, \\u201cFinancial\\nStatements \\u2014 Note 8 \\u2014 Segment Information.\\u201d\\nNet Sales\\nNet sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content\\nwhere we record revenue gross.
